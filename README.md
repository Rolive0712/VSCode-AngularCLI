# VSCode-AngularCLI
My First Angular CLI Project

run command from windows command prompt
* "npm install -g @angular/cli"
 (it will install cli globally)

 * "ng --version"
 (to check version of cli)

 * "ng new <project>"
 (this will create boilerplate and download node packages)
 * go to folder "cd <folder>"
 * run "code." to open code in vs code

 ensure you are on right folder on vs code and then run
 * ng serve"
